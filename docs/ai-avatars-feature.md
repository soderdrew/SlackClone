# AI Avatars Feature Plan

## Overview
AI avatars will allow users to create AI-powered versions of themselves that can be queried by other users. These avatars will be informed by:
- User's bio
- Uploaded knowledge documents
- Profile information

## Technical Components

### 1. Document Processing
- File upload system in profile modal for knowledge documents
- Document parser with chunk size optimized for personality traits
- Metadata system to tag chunks with user IDs and document types
- Integration with existing file upload infrastructure

### 2. Bio Integration
- Enhanced bio field (possibly with formatting/structure)
- Bio preprocessing for embedding
- Weighting system to prioritize bio content vs documents
- Bio-specific embedding strategy

### 3. Avatar System
- New Pinecone index for `user-avatars`
- Stateless conversation modal (similar to current Ask AI)
- System prompt template incorporating:
  - User's bio
  - Relevant document chunks
  - Profile information
- Rate limiting per user/session

## UI/UX Components

### 1. Profile Updates
- Document upload section in existing profile modal
- Document management interface:
  - List of uploaded documents
  - Delete functionality
  - Document status/processing indicators
- Preview button to test your own avatar
- Clear privacy controls and settings

### 2. Avatar Modal
- Based on existing Ask AI modal structure
- Components:
  - User's profile picture and bio display
  - Single question input
  - Response display
  - Clear indication of AI avatar identity
- No conversation history (stateless)
- Loading states and error handling

## Implementation Benefits

### Stateless Approach Advantages
1. Simplified Implementation
   - Reuse of existing modal code
   - Consistent with current app patterns
   - Easier testing and maintenance

2. Performance
   - Lower computational costs
   - No conversation history to process
   - Efficient resource usage

3. User Experience
   - Clear expectations (independent interactions)
   - Familiar interface pattern
   - Quick response times

### Technical Considerations
1. Privacy & Security
   - User control over avatar activation
   - Document privacy settings
   - Rate limiting implementation

2. Performance Optimization
   - Efficient document processing
   - Embedding caching strategies
   - Response time optimization

3. Quality Control
   - Bio and document content filtering
   - Response appropriateness checks
   - Consistent personality maintenance

## Future Enhancements
- Enhanced document type support
- Advanced personality configuration
- Conversation memory (optional)
- Integration with channel discussions
- Avatar-to-avatar interactions
